# PhyAug
This Repo include the code for each case study in IPSN'21 paper: [PhyAug: Physics-Directed Data Augmentationfor Deep Sensing Model Transfer inCyber-Physical Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01160.pdf).

A detailed README how to run the code is constructed for each case study:
- [Case study 1: Keyword Spotting](https://github.com/jiegev5/PhyAug/tree/main/key_word_spotting)
- [Case study 2: Speech Recognition](https://github.com/jiegev5/PhyAug/tree/main/ASR)
- [Case study 3: Seismic Source Localization](https://github.com/jiegev5/PhyAug/tree/main/seismic_localization)

# Dataset
We collect our own dataset for each case study, they are made available public. You can find detailed instructions to download them in each case study link. 
# Hardware specification
DNN models are pretrained and codes are evaluated on our workstation with below specifications:
- CPU: Intel Core i9-7900X 3.30GHz 13.75MB Cache 10C/20T
- GPU: 4x Zotac nVidia RTX2080Ti 11GB GDDR6 PCIe x16 GPU Card
